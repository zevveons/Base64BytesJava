# Base64BytesJava
📘 A custom implementation of the Base64 encoding and decoding algorithm.  🔧 
Does it work? = ✅ 
✅ Understanding of Encoding Concepts
Demonstrates solid knowledge of how Base64 encoding/decoding works at the byte level.

🧠 Bitwise Operation Skills
Shows comfort using low-level operations like bit shifts (>>, <<, &) to manipulate data precisely.

🧱 Manual Implementation of Algorithms
Indicates the ability to reimplement standard algorithms from scratch—useful in interviews and systems-level work.

📚 Familiarity with Data Representation
Understands how binary data can be represented and safely transferred over text-based systems.

🚨 Attention to Edge Cases
The code includes logic for padding and handling data that doesn't align with 3-byte groupings.

🧪 Basic Defensive Programming
Has null and empty input checks (e.g., if (theData == null)), though more could be added.

⚙️ Custom Utility Development
Demonstrates experience writing reusable static utility classes—common in backend Java development.

📦 Use of Static Initializers and Constants
Uses static blocks and constants for performance and readability, signaling good structure awareness.








This implementation can work, Custom vs. Standard Library:
Modern Java already includes Base64 utilities in java.util.Base64, which are more efficient and safer. Prefer using them unless you're required to use a custom version.

Decoding Issue:
The decode method modifies the original encData array in-place when converting characters to values. This is not safe because it corrupts the original data. A copy should be made first to avoid side effects.

Character Safety:
DecodeMap only supports ASCII (0–127). It assumes the encoded data is strictly valid Base64 characters. Invalid or extended ASCII may crash or behave incorrectly.

No Input Validation:
The code lacks error checking (e.g., what if an input byte isn't in the Base64 map?). Invalid input will crash or return incorrect data.

📝 Recommendation for README
This class implements a custom Base64 encoder and decoder for converting binary data to a textual representation and vice versa. It follows the standard Base64 scheme using a 64-character map and includes padding handling. While educational, for production-grade use consider replacing it with java.util.Base64 introduced in Java 8 for better reliability and performance.
